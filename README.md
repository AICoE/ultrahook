# Ultrahook Client for OpenShift

This repository contains [s2i](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) ready [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) application based on [Ultrahook](http://www.ultrahook.com/) Client

## Usage

### Deployment

To import the [template](openshift/template.yaml), run:

```
oc apply -f openshift/template.yaml
```

To deploy the ultrahook client, run:

```
oc process ultrahook ULTRAHOOK_API_KEY=<your_api_key> ULTRAHOOK_SUBDOMAIN=<some_subdomain> ULTRAHOOK_DESTINATION=<destination_url> | oc apply -f -
```

Or you can do the same thing in OpenShift Console UI.

### Webhook Configuration

When you register at http://www.ultrahook.com, you will choose webhook namespace and you will get API key. As you can see above, you need to provide your API key to the deployment. Then you need to choose a subdomain - so that you can use your namespace for multiple destinations. The generated webhook URL will then look like 

```
http://<some_subdomain>.<namespace>.ultrahook.com
```

Which means that if your OpenShift URL is https://my.openshift.com (which is what you put in for `ULTRAHOOK_DESTINATION`) and your build config webhook looks like (generated by [OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/dev_guide/builds/triggering_builds.html#github-webhooks))

```
https://my.openshift.com/oapi/v1/namespaces/somenamespace/buildconfigs/mybuild/webhooks/secret101/github
```

what you paste in Github webhook configuration will look like

```
http://<some_subdomain>.<namespace>.ultrahook.com/oapi/v1/namespaces/somenamespace/buildconfigs/mybuild/webhooks/secret101/github
```
